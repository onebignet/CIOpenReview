OpenReviewScrript �2011-2012 OpenReviewScript.org

CIOpenReview is free, open source software for creating product or service review websites, written in PHP using the CodeIgniter framework (http://codeigniter.com) and released under the GPLv2 license (see the 'LICENSE' file for more details).

CIOpenReview is a fork of the original OpenReviewScript which was abandoned as of 2012. There have been several changes to the original script:

* CIOpenReview now uses CodeIgniter 3.0.6 and has updated requirements (see Server Requirements)
* CIOpenReview uses MySQLi extentions and works on PHP 7.0!
* You can now rate in 1/2 star increments
* Debug information is stored in a table on the DB
* Bootstrap-based Theme
* User password hashed with password_hash() (Much more secure)

Newer features are in the works and I am open to any suggestions:
* Adding admin and user logging
* Improved click-through stats (currently show total click for lifetime of review)
* Language translations
* Improvements in user security
* More themes
* Automatic Social Media submissions on new reviews.

IMPORTANT: This software is currently beta, there will probably be some bugs/issues. Please report them ASAP and I will get them cleared up.
